[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We\u0026rsquo;ve been working for some time doing Continuous Delivery in our teams, and we found that managing feature toggles in our code was a challenge. Not only because toggles are complex to implement properly and each of us implemented their toggles in different ways, but also because toggles evolved rapidly when we were releasing new features.\nA good example of the evolution of a toggle would be to, first, enable our new shiny feature for a subset of users. When the feature has been probed with a subset of the customers, we can enable it for a bigger set of customers (probably multiple countries). However, we want to make sure that the new feature doesn\u0026rsquo;t break the system that is already in production, so we would want to disable it in case the new service that we depend on is down. After testing the new feature under a big load, we might want to progressively enable it to all customers, but with the ability to disable it quickly to all of our customers if we find something problematic (like a security bug). At the end, we want to just enable the feature for all customers and clean up the feature toggle.\nHowever, managing this flow manually is really complex, is error prone and messes up with the code. For example, we would have with something like:\nvar myRelease = feaggle.release(\u0026quot;MY_RELEASE\u0026quot;); var myExperiment = feaggle.experiment(\u0026quot;MY_RELEASE\u0026quot;); if (myRelease.isEnabled() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; myExperiment.isEnabledFor(myCurrentUser)) { newShinyFeature(); }  That later would evolve to:\nvar myRelease = feaggle.release(\u0026quot;MY_RELEASE\u0026quot;); var myExperiment = feaggle.experiment(\u0026quot;MY_EXPERIMENT\u0026quot;); var reportsService = feaggle.operational(\u0026quot;REPORTS_SERVICE_IS_UP\u0026quot;); if (myRelease.isEnabled() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; myExperiment.isEnabledFor(myCurrentUser) \u0026amp;\u0026amp; reportsService.isEnabled()) { newShinyFeature(); }  We found that every change to our rollout strategy would mean that we changed the code that was in production, meaning that we could break it (spoiler, we broke it).\nWe though that having some kind of abstraction over a feature, that could evolve during the lifetime of the feature, was necessary. That\u0026rsquo;s why we came up with the concept of drum-roll Epic.\nSo, what is an epic itself? An epic aggregates a set of toggles (of different types) and is enabled only if all toggles inside the epic are enabled for a cohort. Building an epic is quite easy:\nEpic\u0026lt;MyCohort\u0026gt; epic = feaggle.epic() .release(feaggle.release(\u0026quot;MY_RELEASE\u0026quot;)) // you can add more than one release toggle, just calling .release again .experiment(feaggle.experiment(\u0026quot;MY_EXPERIMENT\u0026quot;)) // also, you can add more than one experiment with .experiment .operational(feaggle.operational(\u0026quot;REPORTS_SERVICE_IS_UP\u0026quot;)) // also here :D .build(); // usage: if (epic.isEnabledFor(myCurrentUser)) { newShinyFeature(); }  There are several awesome features from epics that will let you fall in love with them:\n Epics are lazy. They will evaluate toggles by complexity until finds one that is disabled. For example, if a release is turned off, the epic won\u0026rsquo;t call any experiment or operational toggle. Epics are configured once and can be injected, if you want to change how they work, just reconfigure them. Epics are unaware of how other toggles work. You can use epics with toggles that are stored in your database with feaggle-jdbc or toggles in memory. Your epic won\u0026rsquo;t change.  We believe that epics will be a game changer on how we do Continuous Deliver, as we have more power on how we release our features without sacrificing ease. You can start using epics in feaggle 2.0.0: despite the major version, it\u0026rsquo;s backwards compatible to feaggle 1.x and feaggle-jdbc!\nRead more information on how to use feaggle in the the feaggle repository and remember that if you have any feedback or suggestion,please fill us an issue so we can keep track of them üòç.\n","date":1551830400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551830400,"objectID":"5956b2424addef70476ce8f2f1c6267e","permalink":"http://feaggle.github.io/blog/welcome-epics/","publishdate":"2019-03-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/welcome-epics/","section":"blog","summary":"We\u0026rsquo;ve been working for some time doing Continuous Delivery in our teams, and we found that managing feature toggles in our code was a challenge.

We promote a centralised configuration, outside production code. Changing the status of a toggle doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean changing where we are using the toggle. We believe that releasing features can be done without deploying new code, just changing a toggle. That\u0026rsquo;s why we support hot reloading in our jdbc module.

If you want to refresh some knowledge or you are just starting from scratch on using feature toggles, welcome! We will go through the process of using toggles in our production code and how to release incrementally a feature. We will be also exploring different types of toggles so we know which one to use in which circumstances.\nUsually you want to release new features incrementally because allows you to:\n Verify that the feature works for a subset of your customers. Verify that the feature brings business value without implementing the whole epic. Avoid integration issues with other components, as the code is pushed as soon as possible to production.  Let\u0026rsquo;s say that we want to implement a new version of a feature: a new reporting integration that will allow us to get more information about the billing on our platform. Right now our code looks like:\n@Get(\u0026quot;/report\u0026quot;) public Object getMyBillingReports(User user) { return reports.getReportForUser(user.getId()); }  Sadly, the new reporting service is still under development and lacks some important features. After some investigation we\u0026rsquo;ve found that probably we can release the integration that we have for just a subset of our users: all users that are not premium. It looks like those features are only used for premium users, so we can release earlier!\nWe might want to do something like this:\n@Get(\u0026quot;/report\u0026quot;) public Object getMyBillingReports(User user) { if (user.isNotPremium()) { return newReports.getReport(user); } else { return reports.getReportForUser(user.getId()); } }  However we\u0026rsquo;ve found that the new service is not handling all the load and we overloaded it. It\u0026rsquo;s reasonable to do two things:\n Find a way to easy disable the toggle for everyone if we have problems with the new reporting service. Rollout the feature to a subset of the non-premium users and be able to increase the number of users with access.  The easiest option right now would be:\n@Get(\u0026quot;/report\u0026quot;) public Object getMyBillingReports(User user) { if (isNewReportFeatureEnabled \u0026amp;\u0026amp; user.isNotPremium() \u0026amp;\u0026amp; Math.random() \u0026lt; 0.2f) { // not evenly distributed, but aprox 20% of load. return newReports.getReport(user); } else { return reports.getReportForUser(user.getId()); } }  Configuring feaggle Configuring feaggle depends on which module are you using.
